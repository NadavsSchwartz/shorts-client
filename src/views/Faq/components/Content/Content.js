                    A URL shortener, also known as a link shortener, seems like
                    a simple tool, but it is a service that can dramatically
                    impact your marketing efforts. Link shorteners work by
                    transforming any long URL into a shorter, more readable
                    link.
                  </p>{' '}
                  <br />
                  Then, when a user clicks the shortened version, they’re
                  automatically forwarded to the destination URL.
                  <br />
                  <p>
                    Think of a short URL as a more descriptive and memorable
                    nickname for your long webpage address. You can, for
                    example, use a short URL like shorts.domain/CovidNews so
                    people will have a good idea about where your link will lead
                    before they click it.
                  </p>{' '}

                  online world. Make your URLs stand out with our easy-to-use

                    How many people can even remember a long web address,
                    especially if it has many characters and symbols? A short
                    URL can make your link more memorable. Not only does it
                    allow people to recall and share your link with others
                    easily, but it can also dramatically improve traffic to your
                    content.
                  </p>{' '}
                  <p>
                    On a more practical side, a short URL is also easier to
                    incorporate into your collateral – whether you’re looking to
                    engage with your customers offline or online.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Shorts is the best URL shortener for everyone, from
                    influencers to small brands to large enterprises, who are
                    looking for a simple way to create, track and manage their
                    links.
